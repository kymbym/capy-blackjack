1. Declare variables (arrays) for two decks of cards.
2. Create HTML elements (two <div>s) for the card decks:
1. Deck 1 should display the back of a card with a shadow outline, indicating a larger stack.
2. Deck 2 should display an empty card outline.
3. Create cached element references for each of the card decks.
4. Add an event listener for the "Flip" button.
5. Write an initialization function that assigns 52 cards" to deck 1, then invoke it.
6. Declare a render() function to display a card after it is flipped.
7. Stub up a handleClick() function for the event listener to call.
1. Select a random card from deck 1.
2. Remove the card from deck 1.
3. Add the card to deck 2.
4. Call the render() function and pass the card to it.
8. Within the render() function (situated above handleClick()):
1. After the first card is picked, remove the outline on deck 2.
2. Add the class name to display the card picked on deck 2.
3. When half of the cards are flipped, move the shadow from deck 1 to deck 2.
4. When the final card is picked, add an outline to deck 1.
